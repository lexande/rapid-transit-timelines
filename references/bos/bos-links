search snippet of https://books.google.com/books?id=F25EAAAAIAAJ : "The base headway on the Stoneham line was about 20 minutes and much better" in the rush."
conclusion: due to stops at sheepfold and probable stop at brooks rd, and 20 min headways, fellsway should be shown, to stoneham sq 1910 and farm hill 1915-1945.
