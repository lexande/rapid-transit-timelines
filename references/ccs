https://lagranaldea.com/2020/01/02/el-metro-de-caracas-37-anos-despues/ very poor frequency in 2020 especially on line 2. Moovit reports 49 minute runtime for L1, 24 minutes for L2-Zoo, 35 minutes for L4/2-Adjuntas, and 22 minutes for L3. With 9 trains on L1, 6 on L2 and 4 on L3, that makes best case headways of 11 minutes on L1 and L3, and if the six are split evenly 16 on L2-Zoo and 23 on L4/2-Adjuntas. So best guess is L4/2 fails frequency.
