Notes from October 1974 "Motor Coach Age" article on Public Service Coordinated Transport and ASVs

1935:
49-Union ran gas only when first bustituted, wires from Bound Brook to Broad & W Jersey St Elizabeth by end of the year, gas from there to DL&W station ("Washington St Newark was not fitted with double overhead wire until June 1938".)

1936:
January ordered 15 new ASVs for the hudson county end of 15-Passaic and 10 for Elizabeth (49-Union?).
In fall 15 ASVs assigned to 31-S Orange, 23 to 11-Elizabeth and 16 for Passaic half of 15-Passaic.
December ordered 25 for Elizabeth/S Orange/Passaic west, 20 to 4-Haddonfield, 30 to 21-WNY and 25-Weehawken, 14 for 9-Clifton, 40 for 1-Newark, 46 for 25-Sprinfield, 20 for 39-Harrison.

1937:
March 21 inaugurated 47-Union Express, mostly duplicated 49-Union but used more direct route (without wires) between Garwood and Plainfield and had limited stops where it overlapped 49.
March 22 Passaic half of 15-Passaic formally converted to ASV but had no double-overhead at all.
4-Haddonfield had gas buses replaced with ASVs (streetcars had last run 1932).
May 16 11-Montgomery and 13-Greenville converted to ASV. 12 and 14 also ASV but no wires erected over the motor bus routes via Newark and Jersey Ave (nor on any other streets between Jersey Ave and Exchange Pl for that matter) until summer 1938. 
Jun 20-August 1, 9-Clifton 25-Springfield 17-Paterson 19-Orange and 1-Newark converted. 17 minor by that time, but 74 converted to ASV at the same time. South of Glendale Loop route 17 ASVs ran gas until conversion of 13-Broad.
September 5: 13-Broad and 39-Harrison converted
December 29: 27-Mt Prospect converted

Route 74 ASVs under wire on Main Ave Passaic. Pans for raising wires at Washington Park Newark. Netwon Creek Collingswood trestle converted for ASVs by fall 1937 with Rt 50 ASVs under wire from PRR Ferry Camden to Kings Hwy Haddon Hts.

1938:
Jan & Feb converted gas-electric ASVs put in service on nominal bus routes 16-Clinton, 18-N Newark, 26-Springfield, 32-S Orange and 38-Kearny Rutherford, sometimes using their poles offpeak only. (Also 34-Mt Ephraim in southern div.) Sounds like these only used poles on shared sections? Ended during WW2.
February double overhead on Broad St Newark energized
May 1 43-Jersey City converted, ultimately electrified end-to-end.
March 27: 21-WNY and 25-Weehawken use under wire begins.
June 15: 9-Newark Ave converted, wire over whole line by September 1.

1941: Wire on Clay St Bridge from Newark to E Newark, never used by streetcars. Only used by off-peak route 38 ASVs.

1942: Very last section of ASV overhead completed across Hackensack River Br on 1-Newark January 31, 1942. As ov that date all ASV routes were all-electric with these exceptions: Haddon Hts (Kings Hwy-Clementon), Haddonfield (via Maple Ave), short segments of Camden 32 & 34, Union Express (Garwood to Plainfield), and Hackensack River Br portion of 43-Jersey City. Wire had been put on that bridge March 1941 but not used until October 16, 1942.

1943:
"Worthington Pump" (Supor Blvd?) branch added to 43-Jersey City, probably not electrified?

1944:
November 15, electric operation of outer portion (beyond Collings Ave) of 50-Haddon Hts ended. Ended beyond Woodlynne November 4 1946, ended entirely January 1 1947.


In addition to the ex-streetcar ASV routes mentioned by Hamm, the following not-fully-electrified routes used ASVs with overhead power on some sections:
16 - Clinton: 1937-1941 (offpeak only)
18 - N Newark: 1938-1941 (offpeak only)
26 - Springfield: 1938-1941
32 - S Orange: 1936-1941 (offpeak only)
38 - Kearny Rutherford: 1938-1942 (offpeak only)
47 - Union Express: 1937-1947
50 - Newark-Hillside-Elizabeth: 1938-1941

Hudson county routes 12 and 14 were variants of ex-streetcar ASV routes 11 and 13 which also used ASVs


Tangentially, 1974 base headways of routes that had used the Cedar St Subway:
43-Jersey City 45 (but had be routed out of Cedar St in 1948)
62-Perth Amboy 60
128-Paterson 45
134-New Brunswick 60
