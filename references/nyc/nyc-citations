regarding SIRT headways at end of 1955:
"City to Observe 50th Year of Operation of its Nicke-Fare Staten Island Ferries" October 22, 1955
"Port Operating, But With Delays" March 20, 1956
Both suggest 10 minute ferry headways in morning rush at end of 1955, more compatible with the 30-minute April 1955 SIRT schedule from the 1955-10 Official Guide than the 15-minute-to-GK October 1956 schedule from the 1957-03 Official Guide.
