current guesses:
- frequent service north of Andheri began with the 1953-55 quad-tracking(?) referenced in http://cityrailtransit.com/timeline/mumbai_timeline.htm
- frequent harbour branch & central beyond Kurla service began in the early 50s, around the time of the grouping into the Central Railway, the extension of electric suburban service to Mankhurd, and the western line expansion noted above
- frequent service north of Borivali to Virar began in the early 70s with electrification north of Virar and quad-tracking(?) of Churchgate approach referenced in http://cityrailtransit.com/timeline/mumbai_timeline.htm (but it could have started in the 50s for all I know, or maybe even not until the 2000s)
